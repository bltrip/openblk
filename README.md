#OpenMusic.Gallery#

OMG is an instrument, an audio workstation, and a distribution platform
all rolled into one, based on the idea of open music.

Open music means that with a few taps of your finger, you can remix the
music in OpenMusic.Gallery.

Open music also means you can use it for your projects royalty free.

sudo if you want to use port 80 which is how it is set. Needs a postgresql installed (9.4 or later).
