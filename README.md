# OpenMusic.Gallery

is...

* A musical instrument
* An audio workstation
* A distribution platform

all in one web app, for **open music**.

**Open music** is like open source software:

* You get the music in "source code format"
* You're allowed to modify and use the music however you want 

That means that with a few taps of your finger, you can remix the music in OpenMusic.Gallery, and use it royalty free.

You can see it in action here: https://openmusic.gallery.
